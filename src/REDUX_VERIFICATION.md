```

### Dispatch Working
```
✓ dispatch(toggleDarkMode()) works
✓ dispatch(setSidebarOpen(true)) works
✓ dispatch(setNotificationsOpen(false)) works
✓ dispatch(markAllAsRead()) works
✓ dispatch(logout()) works
✓ dispatch(addNotification(...)) works
```

### Component Behavior
```
✓ Sidebar toggles correctly
✓ Dark mode toggles correctly
✓ Notifications panel opens/closes
✓ Notifications mark as read
✓ User profile displays
✓ Role-based menu items show
✓ Logout works
✓ Navigation works
```

## 🎯 Code Quality Check

### TypeScript
```
✓ No 'any' types used
✓ All interfaces defined
✓ All types exported
✓ Full type inference
