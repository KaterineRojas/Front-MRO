## 🚀 Current State Management

### Before (Local State)
```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState(mockUser);
const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = useState(false);
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);
```
**Problems:**
- ❌ State scattered across components
- ❌ Hard to share between components
- ❌ No central source of truth
- ❌ Difficult to debug

### After (Redux State)
```tsx
const user = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth.user);
const sidebarOpen = useAppSelector((state) => state.ui.sidebarOpen);
const darkMode = useAppSelector((state) => state.ui.darkMode);
const notifications = useAppSelector((state) => state.notifications.items);
```
**Benefits:**
- ✅ All state centralized
- ✅ Easy to share across components
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Redux DevTools for debugging

## 📊 State Structure

```typescript
{
  auth: {
    user: {
      id: 1,
      name: "John Smith",
      role: "administrator",
      email: "john@company.com"
    },
    isAuthenticated: true
  },
  ui: {
    sidebarOpen: false,
    darkMode: false,
    notificationsOpen: false
  },
  notifications: {
    items: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: "New Request Pending",
        message: "Mike Chen submitted a loan request",
        timestamp: "5 minutes ago",
        read: false,
        type: "warning"
      },
      // ... more notifications
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🎓 How to Use Redux Now

### 1. Read State
```tsx
import { useAppSelector } from './store';

const user = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth.user);
```

### 2. Update State
```tsx
import { useAppDispatch, toggleDarkMode } from './store';

const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
dispatch(toggleDarkMode());
```

### 3. Use Selectors
```tsx
import { useAppSelector, selectUnreadCount } from './store';

const count = useAppSelector(selectUnreadCount);
```

---

## 🔧 Next Steps (Optional)

Want to add more features? Here's what you can do:

### Add Inventory Slice
```tsx
// store/slices/inventorySlice.ts
interface InventoryState {
  items: Item[];
  loading: boolean;
  filters: Filters;
}
```

### Add Purchase Orders Slice
```tsx
// store/slices/purchaseOrdersSlice.ts
interface PurchaseOrdersState {
  orders: Order[];
  activeTab: string;
}
```

### Add Loan Requests Slice
```tsx
// store/slices/loanRequestsSlice.ts
interface LoanRequestsState {
  requests: Request[];
  selectedRequest: Request | null;
}
```

**But this is OPTIONAL!** Your current Redux setup is complete and working perfectly.
